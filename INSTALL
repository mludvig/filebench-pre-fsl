Building Solaris a Solaris Package
----------------------------------

To build a full Solaris package, you will need access to a Solaris AMD64 
and Solaris SPARC platform

On each platform, in the same directory:

$ ./configure --prefix=/opt
$ make clean
$ make package

The first will cite a lack of binaries from the other platform. The package
will be built once binaries are present for both ISA's.


Building on Linux and Other
---------------------------

We are currently testing the build on MacOSX and Linux 2.4/2.6.

These ports are dependent on the gsl libraries version 1.4 or greater.

To compile:

$ ./configure --with-gsl=<path to gsl>
$ make install
